# Clients-APs-Counter

Two simple python scripts that count the quantity of clients connected to all APs and switches,for both private and public networks,  of all the shopping malls managed by a particular company. Then integrate the final data into a timebased database(InfluxDB) so they can make graphics out of it. 

- apscrawler1 - Accesses all the organizations in Cisco Meraki Dashboard and genarate a csv file containing all the APs and switches serial numbers(together with the organizations name, networkId and ap/switch name).

- apscrawler2 - Reads the csv generated by apscrawler1, use all the serials from the csv as paramaters for gettig the quantity of clients connected to all the devices and generates a dataframe with results. Then a session on InfluxDB is started, if the database where all the data are going to be living in doesn't exist, the script will create one(which is the case for the first time the client will run it), then all the data is written into the new database. The next time the clients runs it, it will repeate the whole process again but when the InfluxDB session is started the script will read all the databases the client has and look for our target one, if it's there then the new data is written into.

The client then can make different sorts of graphics based on the final data using Grafana for example.
